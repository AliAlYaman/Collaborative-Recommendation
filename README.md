# Collaborative Recommendation System

This project implements a **Collaborative Movie Recommendation System** using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and collaborative filtering techniques. The system recommends movies based on user ratings and a given input movie title.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies based on user-item interactions (ratings).
- **KNN Algorithm**: Implements similarity-based recommendations.
- **Data Filtering**: Filters users and movies based on minimum thresholds for robust recommendations.
- **Visualization**: Displays user and movie activity in the dataset.
- **Ease of Use**: Returns a ranked list of similar movies for a given input.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib scipy scikit-learn
   ```

3. Place the `movies.csv` and `ratings.csv` datasets in a folder named `data`.

## Dataset Description

1. **`movies.csv`**:
   - Columns:
     - `movieId`: Unique identifier for each movie.
     - `title`: Movie title.

2. **`ratings.csv`**:
   - Columns:
     - `userId`: Unique identifier for each user.
     - `movieId`: ID of the movie rated by the user.
     - `rating`: User's rating for the movie.

## Results
For a given movie title, the system outputs:
- A list of the top 10 recommended movies.
- A similarity score (distance) for each recommendation.
